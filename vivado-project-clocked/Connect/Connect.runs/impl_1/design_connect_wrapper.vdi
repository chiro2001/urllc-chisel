WARNING: [Vivado 12-4702] SLEW is not a supported property on input port(s). Setting is ignored. [D:/Programs/urllc-chisel/xdc/generic/generic.xdc:5]
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1055] Clock 'clk_50M' completely overrides clock 'clock_in', which is referenced by one or more other constraints. Any constraints that refer to the overridden clock will be ignored.

Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.
