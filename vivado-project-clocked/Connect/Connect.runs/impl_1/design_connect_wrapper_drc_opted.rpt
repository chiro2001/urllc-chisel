PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/ddc/dataReg[7]_i_4 is driving clock pin of 19 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[0], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[1], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[2], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[0], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[1], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[2], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[3], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[4], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[5], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[6], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[7], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[0], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[1], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[2], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[3] (the first 15 of 19 listed)
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/cnt[2]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 11 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[0], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[1], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[2], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[0], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[1], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[2], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[3], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[4], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[5], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[6], design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/sender/adcRead/data_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
