TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.005 ns between design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/ddc/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_connect_clk_wiz_0_0_1) and design_connect_i/ConnectWrapper_0/inst/Connect/receiver/ddc/sum_reg[19]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_connect_clk_wiz_0_0_1).

Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
