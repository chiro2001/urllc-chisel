WARNING: [Vivado 12-4702] SLEW is not a supported property on input port(s). Setting is ignored. [D:/Programs/urllc-chisel/xdc/generic/generic.xdc:5]
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1055] Clock 'clk_50M' completely overrides clock 'clock_in', which is referenced by one or more other constraints. Any constraints that refer to the overridden clock will be ignored.

Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/ddc/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/ddc/dataReg[7]_i_4/O, cell design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/ddc/dataReg[7]_i_4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/ddc/dataReg[7]_i_4 is driving clock pin of 19 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[0], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[1], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[2], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[0], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[1], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[2], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[3], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[4], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[5], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[6], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[7], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[0], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[1], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[2], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[3]... and (the first 15 of 19 listed)
