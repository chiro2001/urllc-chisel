Input pipelining  
DSP design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_1_reg input design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_1_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_2_reg input design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_2_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_3_reg input design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_3_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_4_reg input design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_4_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.

DPIP-1#6 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_5_reg input design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_5_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_0_reg multiplier stage design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/waveBuffer_0_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/ddc/dataReg[7]_i_4 is driving clock pin of 19 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[0], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[1], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/cnt_reg[2], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[0], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[1], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[2], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[3], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[4], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[5], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[6], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/dataReg_reg[7], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[0], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[1], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[2], design_receiver_i/ReceiverWrapper_0/inst/Receiver/dacWrite/data_reg[3] (the first 15 of 19 listed)
