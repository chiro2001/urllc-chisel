XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 20.000 -name clk_50M [get_ports clock_in] (Source: /home/chiro/programs/urllc-chisel/xdc/generic/generic.xdc (Line: 6))
