CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1055] Clock 'clk_50M' completely overrides clock 'clock_in', which is referenced by one or more other constraints. Any constraints that refer to the overridden clock will be ignored.

Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[6] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/sender_ad_clk_INST_0/O, cell design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/sender_ad_clk_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/sender_ad_clk_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 11 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[0], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[1], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/cnt_reg[2], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[0], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[1], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[2], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[3], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[4], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[5], design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[6], and design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[7]
