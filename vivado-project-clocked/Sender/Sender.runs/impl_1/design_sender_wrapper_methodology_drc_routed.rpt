Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell

The clock pin design_sender_i/SenderWrapper_0/inst/sender/adcRead/data_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 20.000 -name clk_50M [get_ports clock_in] (Source: /home/chiro/programs/urllc-chisel/xdc/generic/generic.xdc (Line: 6))
Previous: create_clock -period 20.000 [get_ports clock_in] (Source: /home/chiro/programs/urllc-chisel/vivado-project-clocked/Sender/Sender.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_sender/ip/design_sender_clk_wiz_0_0/design_sender_clk_wiz_0_0.xdc (Line: 56))
